Apply automatic discounts to specific WooCommerce products based on total product price (price Ã— quantity). Easy rule management and flexible product targeting.

== Description ==

**Conditional Product Discount** is a lightweight WooCommerce extension that lets you apply percentage-based discounts on specific products if their total price (price Ã— quantity) exceeds defined thresholds.

Perfect for creating volume-based promotions, bulk discounts, and custom pricing strategies without touching a single line of code.

### ðŸ§  Features:

- Set multiple discount rules based on total product price
- Apply discounts to individual products, not the entire cart
- Define rules for specific products using a searchable multi-select
- Prevent overly generous giveaways with a 100% cap
- Add and manage rules from a clean, responsive admin panel
- Select2-powered UI for fast product selection
- Works seamlessly with WooCommerce carts

### ðŸ›  Use Case Example:

- Buy more than â‚¹800 worth of a product â†’ get 10% off  
- Over â‚¹1200 of a product â†’ get 20% off  
- Over â‚¹1500 â†’ get 25% off  

All discounts are applied automatically when the product meets the defined threshold.
